# Challenge 12 - Hackerman Origins

Everyone has an origin, a first step in their career. Hackerman is no different. His first job as an SRE was going smoothly. He used to manage public keys from different third parties that are used to encrypt data. He liked to do initial encryption tests by sending encrypted data with no padding to the third party to validate communication.

But one day he lost a public key file after the test was done. He was extremely embarrassed and didn't want to ask the third party for the key file again. Instead, he decided to use his growing hacking skills to recover the key from test data. How could he do it?
